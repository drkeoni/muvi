### Jotting down ideas

I like the vinyl-inspired audio reactive video [here](http://mattdesl.github.io/spins/).  First could do the same thing
with color and MFCCs.  Thinking about having the line change direction as it spirals around (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise).
Multiple spirals?  Particle interactions?  3D?

An array of hexagons, like lily pads.  Light up with MFCC signals.

I really like the effect where foreground images are very sharp (and photorealistic ideally) and the background is
heavily blurred (depth of focus effect).

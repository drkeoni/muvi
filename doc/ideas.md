### Jotting down ideas

I like the vinyl-inspired audio reactive video [here](http://mattdesl.github.io/spins/).  First could do the same thing
with color and MFCCs.  Thinking about having the line change direction as it spirals around (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise).
Multiple spirals?  Particle interactions?  3D?

An array of hexagons, like lily pads.  Light up with MFCC signals.

I really like the effect where foreground images are very sharp (and photorealistic ideally) and the background is
heavily blurred (depth of focus effect).

Wrapping the musical line around a faux music box cylinder,
rotating in the middle of the screen.  Lines of "music" spin off.

Go back to a crystal simulation I programmed in England.  Have a landscape
growing from falling snow crystals or sand or water drops, where the
drops hit some of them grow and become Lindenmayer ferns.
